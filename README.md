# Food-delivery-ML-project-with-regression-model

## Project Overview
This project analyzes logistical data from food delivery services to identify key drivers of delays. It concludes with a Machine Learning model built to predict delivery times based on real-time environmental factors.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning Pipeline:** Automated processing of messy logistical datasets using Pandas.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualization of bimodal delivery distributions and traffic impact using Seaborn.
- **Predictive Modeling:** A Multiple Linear Regression model achieving an $R^2$ score of 0.85.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/delivery-logistics-ml.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib`
3. Open `Assignment.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
